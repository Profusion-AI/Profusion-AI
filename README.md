👋 Hi, I’m @Profusion-AI, but you can call me Kyle

👀 I’m interested in the ethical alignment of AI, exploring the profound implications of AI decisions in real-world scenarios, and understanding the broader societal impact of AI technologies.

🌱 I’m currently diving deep into how alignment affects businesses and governments, with a keen focus on aiding policy development around AI adoption. I'm passionate about ensuring that as AI becomes more integrated into our daily lives, it does so with a strong ethical foundation.

🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on building an innovative app for the AI Debate Arena concept. The idea is to create a platform where users can engage in meaningful debates with an LLM on a myriad of topics centered around ethics and philosophy. If you're passionate about AI, ethics, or both, I'd love to hear from you!

📫 How to reach me: Feel free to drop me an email at kyle [at] profusion [dot] ai. I'm always open to discussions, collaborations, or just a chat about the fascinating world of AI!
